A person has taken a loan of $6000.00 with a fixed annual interest rate of 6% for 5 years with no down payment. The monthly payment has been fixed at $116.00 for entire term of the loan. <br/><br/>Here is the formula to calculate monthly fixed payment: (NOTE: See attachment)
<br/>    P = (monthly rate * Loan amount) / (1 - (1+monthly interest rate)^-n) <br/>Here n is the number of payment periods.<br/>
<br/>Write a program to: <br/>1. To calculate monthly payment <br/>2. To print out monthly payment and total interest payment for the duration of loan rounded to its nearest integer
